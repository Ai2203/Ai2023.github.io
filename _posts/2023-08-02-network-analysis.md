# Network Analysis

## What network analysis is
Netwok analysis is a useful method of looking at data and connections between entities. The visualisation of networks helps to understand the links between topics, people, or organisations. 

## What we did
To learn network analysis, we looked at books published in Sociology of Religion. We analyzed co-authorships of editors and identified, which scholars worked together. 
With network analysis it is also possible to identify co-occurence of topics in published resources.
Overall I found network analysis a very useful instrument for working with data. It structures big portions of information and shows connections, which could not be easily understood otherwise.
In the example used in class, we worked with factual information about texts (books and editors). I would be greatly interested in other possibilities of network analysis. 

## How we did it
To conduct the analysis we used OpenRefine once again. We reduced the corpus of data to entities most valuable to our particular case: published books and editors. With OpenRefine and clear instructions on coding,
it appears to be a rather straight-forward process. When we had books and editors lined up, we asked OpenRefine to list pairs of editors. 
Afterwards, the list with pair of editors was added to [Palladio][1] - tool for visualisation. Palladio then processed the list and showed the network of editors. In such a way there was a clear picture of which scholars
often worked together. The tool also offers some means to customise the visualisation: e.g. the size of clusters. One drawback of Palladio is that it does not allow to download the resulting image. 

To conclude, network analysis is a greatly useful method and I am looking forward to applying it in my studies and work.
