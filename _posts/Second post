title: Using Openrefine for data restructuring
categories: [openrefine, reflexion]

# What Openrefine is
Openrefine is a web-based tool that helps working with unstructured data: cleaning it, changing its formats and making it more convenient to use for the researcher. 

# What we did with Openrefine
In class, we practiced extracting necessary data from Internet sources. For example, we used the Smithsonian institute online repository of cultural objects in order to extract the information about those objects: their location, material they are made from, and dimensions. 
Instead of transporting the data from the website manually, one can use Openrefine for more automatic, hence quick achievement of the task. 

# How I found Openrefine
To my mind, the tool is useful and certainly very helpful when it comes to working with data. Simple design allows for a quick start and intuitive navigation.
It is, though, challenging to actually write up the commands for the programme, since one needs to know the specific language the tool uses and also how it works, but with good practice, I believe,
that could be overcome.
