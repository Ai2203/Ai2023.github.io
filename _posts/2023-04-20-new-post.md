# H1 The first post: coding with Markdown

## H2 How did I find Markdown
In the course "Digital tool for the study of religions" we learned about coding in Markdown. I had a very brief experience with coding before, where I tried to learn coding in html using Visual Studio Code. 
Coding with Markdown looks and is a lot easier than html. While it isn't as complex as html it still useful and allows for as much creative expression as possible. 

## H2 What did we use to learn coding in Markdown
First of all, the Introduction was a useful page to get the first impression of Markdown. 
Then we tried to get the practical hold of coding in Zettler.
And now this very post is also created with Markdown.
